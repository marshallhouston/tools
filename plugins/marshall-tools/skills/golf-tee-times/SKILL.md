description: Check available golf tee times across marshall's bookmarked Denver-area courses on a given date, filtered by player count, time window, and hole count. Use this skill whenever marshall asks about tee times, checking for available golf slots, booking golf, "when can I play", checking golf availability, or any request to search multiple golf courses for open tee times. This skill handles 11 specific Denver-area courses spanning five different booking platforms (CPS Golf, TeeItUp, MemberSports, ClubCaddie, EZLinks) and knows the quirks of each one. Use it proactively even if marshall doesn't explicitly say "tee times" — phrases like "can I play golf Saturday morning" or "find me a round this weekend" should trigger it too.

# Golf tee times

Marshall has 11 bookmarked Denver-area golf courses spanning five booking platforms. This skill checks all of them in one shot for a given date/time window/player count.

## Defaults (when marshall doesn't specify)

- **Players**: 1
- **Time window**: 7:00–10:00 AM (morning)
- **Holes**: 18
- **Walking/riding**: no preference

Always confirm the date — don't assume. If marshall says "Saturday" without a date, verify which Saturday.

## Step 1 — Try the Python script first

Run `scripts/check_tee_times.py` with the date, player count, earliest time, latest time, and hole count. It hits the known JSON endpoints for the four scriptable platforms (CPS Golf, TeeItUp, MemberSports, ClubCaddie) and returns a merged JSON blob.

```bash
python scripts/check_tee_times.py --date 2026-04-11 --players 1 --start 07:00 --end 10:00 --holes 18
```

The script covers 9 of the 11 courses. It will print results for:

- Westminster (Walnut Creek / Legacy Ridge) — CPS Golf
- Indian Tree — CPS Golf
- Westwoods — CPS Golf *(may require login cookie; see platform notes)*
- Hyland Hills — TeeItUp
- Common Ground — TeeItUp
- Riverdale — TeeItUp
- Denver Muni (Wellshire, City Park, Willis Case, Overland, Kennedy, Harvard Gulch) — MemberSports
- Foothills (Foothills GC, Meadows) — MemberSports
- Broken Tee Englewood — MemberSports
- Applewood — ClubCaddie

If the script returns results for everything it covers, skip to Step 3.

## Step 2 — Handle the browser-only courses

Two courses can't be hit via simple HTTP calls and need the browser (Chrome MCP):

### City of Aurora (EZLinks)

Aurora is behind a Cloudflare bot-check that fails inside the MCP tab group. The workaround: marshall must be logged in to the Aurora site in his regular Chrome tab **and** the Chrome MCP tab group must share that browser profile's cookies — which it does not by default. In practice: ask marshall to paste the filtered results, or use computer-use on his already-open tab via screenshots.

URL: `https://cityofaurora.ezlinksgolf.com/index.html#/search`

Aurora courses worth noting in results: Aurora Hills, Meadow Hills, Murphy Creek, Saddle Rock, Springhill. Ignore "~ Back 9" entries — those are 9-hole rounds, not 18.

### West Woods (CPS Golf, login-gated)

The Westwoods CPS Golf instance at `westwoodsarvada.cps.golf` requires an authenticated session even to view tee times. The MCP tab won't share cookies with marshall's logged-in tab. Same workaround as Aurora: computer-use on his open tab, or ask him to paste.

If marshall hasn't mentioned logging in, tell him upfront: "Aurora and Westwoods need you logged in — open them in Chrome and let me know, or paste the results."

## Step 3 — Present the results

Format as a table grouped by availability. Put courses **with** matching tee times first, then a compact "no availability" section. For each hit, show:

- Course name
- Time
- Sub-course if applicable (e.g. "Walnut Creek Tee10", "Applewood - Front")
- Price
- Player range (e.g. "1–4")

Example:

```
## Sat Apr 11, 2026 · 18 holes · 1 player · 7–10 AM

Available:
  8:40 AM   Aurora Hills         $37–$42   1–3 players
  8:42 AM   Saddle Rock          $33.50–$63   1–2 players

No morning availability:
  Westminster · Indian Tree · Hyland Hills · Common Ground ·
  Riverdale · Applewood · Foothills 18 · Broken Tee Championship ·
  Denver muni 18-holes

Couldn't check:
  West Woods (login required)
```

Keep the summary short. Marshall knows these courses and doesn't need them re-explained.

## Notes on the courses and their platforms

See `references/courses.md` for the full course list with URLs, platform quirks, and known aerification/closure dates.

## When single-player slots are rare

It's common for 1-player 18-hole slots to be hard to find, especially on weekend mornings — most booking sites prioritize 2-4 player groups, and solo slots get snapped up quickly. If nothing shows up, suggest:

1. Widening the window (e.g., 7 AM–noon)
2. Trying walk-ons at courses that accept them (Kennedy, Wellshire on Denver muni)
3. Booking a 2-player slot and showing up solo (allowed at most courses)
4. Checking again closer to the date — single-player slots open up as groups reshuffle

Don't suggest these unprompted on the first result; only mention them if the search genuinely returns nothing.

## Updating the course list

The course list lives in `references/courses.json`. If marshall adds or removes a bookmark, update it there.
